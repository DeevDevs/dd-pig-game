This is a simple browser game for desktop browsers. It is one of the first projects I have participated in, and I decided to give it some credits by addin to my portfolio. Initially, the game was created by Jonas Shmedtmann (see his Udemy account: https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/), and I participated in its development. Small upgrade and deployment are my personal contributions. You can try it by following this link: https://deevdevs-pig-game.netlify.app/
