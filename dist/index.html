The player has to roll a dice to get the points. If the value on a dice is higher than '1' - this value is added to the 'current bank' of the player. Then, he can roll the dice again, or save the earned points in the 'main bank'. Once he saves the points in the 'main bank', the turn goes to the second player. The player can roll as many times as he wants to increase the total number of points in his 'current bank'. However, if he rolls '1', his 'current bank' will be emptied immediately and the turn will go to the second player. So, there is always a risk for the player, when he rolls a dice having some points in the 'current bank' already. Eventually, the player who reaches 100 points in his 'main bank' first - wins! </p> </div> <script defer type="module" src="/index.bb499cc3.js"></script> </body></html>
